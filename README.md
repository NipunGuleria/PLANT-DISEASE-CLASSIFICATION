# PLANT-DISEASE-CLASSIFICATION

 This notebook demonstrates an image classification pipeline using TensorFlow and Keras, designed to work with an image dataset from a directory (possibly related to plant images, as suggested by "PlantVillage"). Key components include setting image processing parameters, configuring a CNN model architecture, and defining training parameters such as batch size and epochs. Additionally, Matplotlib is used for data visualization.
